# RandomNumberGenerator-
# The program will generate a list of random numbers and will do following functions: 
# (1) It will ask user to enter the amount of random number from 1-100. 
# (2) From the data entered by user it will display total random numbers and their values. 
# (3) Then it will calculate the minimum number from the list generated without min function. 
# (4) Then it will calculate the maximum number from the list generated without max function. 
# (5) Then it will calculate the total sum of all the numbers from the list generated without in-build function. 
# (6) Then it will calculate the average of all the numbers from the list genereated without in-build function.
